            Module 1 Design Documentation: Generative Art
        </h1>
        <p><i>Diego Rivas Lazala</i></p>

        <h2>VisionüñºÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
            The initial goal of my artistic vision was to paint a fall theme using generative art as a set of painter's tools. 
            Almost immediately, I thought of how busy my fall semester has started and I wanted to recreate something that embodied 
            that experience of clearing your notifications momentarily. I wanted to create a piece that was both calming and chaotic.
            Chaos would erupt when those notifications jumped back up. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Design Choicesüé®</h2>
        <p>
            An important design choice started with drawing inspiration from ChatGPT's attempting at 
            recreating my vision. I wanted to learn more about how animations worked programtically 
            and requested one of the simplest animations that came to mind: raining items with 
            a changing background. This request also gave me an idea on how to iterate as I figured out the 
            best way to fulfill my artistic vision. <br><br>

            The first item that rained from the top of the screen were triangles of differing colors, so I can
            get my bearings on how to translate code into art. <br><br>

            The next iteration of the vision was to include a changing image in the background so I can 
            learn how to layer items on top of each other while taking into consideration timing. <br><br>

            Needless to say, I got carried away playing with the basics that I started
            running low on time. This is when my vision changed to a more concrete piece with the goal 
            of recreating time-based animated desktops screensavers, but they were more relatable. 
            Like watching leaves fall as you chat with friends on a warm fall day. Afterwards, 
            my vision's goal shifted to providing a window for students who might not be aware to what's 
            happening outside of the purview of their computer. These things included the weather,
            time, diseases and many others. <br><br>

            I was able to accomplish the goal of representing time, weather and diseases in my piece. 
            Time was represented by the progression out of fall, into sick season and then into winter. 
            I attempted to represent the weather by changing the background to reflect the time outside
            and different items were animated such that they fell from the top of the screen to the bottom.
            For the fall season where some sun light can be scavenged, there are red leaves dropping from the
            metaphorical top of the screen. For the sick season, there are green viruses that fall from the top. 
            Lastly as winter approaches and you are at Columbia, you find yourself missing the snow while you 
            hold the same view of butler's ceiling for hours on end. <br><br>

            The sprinkle on top of this <b>attempt</b> at fulfilling my vision was an email icon
            with a notification badge. This was such a symbol that I constructed it from a simple red circle,
            decreasing white text and a particular position on the screen. Now, look. Digest. See below.<br><br>

            This final execution was supposed to iterate through the various seasons, which would naturally occur
            over a longer period of time. For display purposes, I shortened the transition between the seasons
            and the repo holds some advice on how to tweak the duration of each season.

        <h2>Bumps In The Roadüöß</h2>
        <p>
            One major bump that I faced was getting started. I felt like there were various ideas I could've latched onto and 
            attempted to execute. This served as a major reason as to why I turned to ChatGPT, thus resulting in inspiration to
            understand what's programatically possible and make initial steps towards some vision. <br><br>

            Ever since I started tinkering with the code, I was unable to cleanly display images utilizing the pushImage()
            function defined within the TFT_eSPI and SPI libraries. It would either display an something that resembled tv static
            and there was a slight outline of the intended image in the foreground. Many tinkering fits later, I decided to
            utilize a library that would intake JPEG images and display them on the screen reliably: TJpg_Decoder. <br><br>

            For the motion required for each animation, I depended on the sprites within the TFT_eSPI library since they 
            allowed for more specific controls over the icons on the screen. Beforehand, I was just generating 
            triangles using some interesting math and the fillTriangle() function. But this served too difficult to 
            debug and there was a convenient sprite tutorial that was sent by our professor. In search of the tinker, 
            I spent sometime learning the fundamentals of sprite motion and treating them as objects. <br><br>

        <h2>Closing Thoughtsü§îüí≠</h2>
        <p>
            This project has helped me build a profund appreciation for people who sit down and help turn text into art. 
            Whether it be the art-enabling libraries or the people taking the time to transform code within an IDE into 
            machine readable code, my deepest thanks go out to them. As I pondered what I would include in this design
            documentation, the idea of making some sort of physical presentation of the pomodoro method--away from your 
            ringing apple-shaped clocks. Need something to interactive with during the breaks....egh...might build it<br><br>
